                    Brigho serves as an intermediary between two or more people who have agreed between and/or among
                    themselves to carry out a financial transaction for the exchange or a item. We receive money from
                    the potential Buyer, safe-keep the money in our custody for both the Buyer and the Seller. Only when both
                    the Seller and the Buyer complete the transaction do we send money for the item to the Seller.
                    A completed transaction is one in which the Buyer has collected the item sent by the Seller.
                    <span class="color-blue-light">
                        For this service we take a small commission of 2.5% on every transaction.

                <p style="font-weight:bold">
                    When the transaction cannot be completed between the Seller and the Buyer for whatever reason, money sent by the Buyer to Brigho for the purchase of the item is sent back to the Buyers account less the cost of delivery (which goes to the Seller) and the commission of 2.5% which goes to Brigho.

                    Brigho thus operates a functional warehousing account through which a Seller and a Buyer not too familiar with one another can successfully transact a business. We provide trust and assurance between two or more unknown parties who are interested in carrying out a transaction thus enabling and encouraging Nigerians to sell their items.
