                    Before using this App, it is expected that the Buyer and Seller have already agreed on modalities including cost of goods, cost of delivery, means of transportation and point of collection. Below are the procedures after these above have been agreed.
                </p>
                <p>

                        <li>
                            The Seller uses the Brigho app to start the process of the transaction by clicking the PLUS bottom on the Seller’s Dashboard.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Seller inputs his details including Banking details (which will be credited soon as the transaction is completed), his/her phone number (which will be used in communication between all transactional parties); the Buyer’s phone number (which will be used in communication between all transactional parties); the agreed Price of the item and the agreed cost of delivery.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The app will automatically calculate our commission. See our ToC&U. The app will also calculate the total cost of the transaction.

                        <li>
                            The Seller then submits the transaction for approval by the Buyer.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Brigho will instantly send a Transaction Number to the Buyer. The Buyer will use this code to approve the transaction as well as track its status.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The Buyer then views the transaction entered by the Seller.

                        <li>
                            If the Buyer is okay with the details of the transaction entered by the Seller, he or she then verifies then accepts the transaction and is immediately redirected to a secured page for payment.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            After payment in made the Buyer will receive a Delivery Number. This code shall be used only to claim the items.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            At the point of collecting the goods, the Buyer still has the last option of declining the goods if he or she is dissatisfied with the items. It is extremely important that the Buyer Verifies the Delivery Number at the point of collection. See our ToC&U and FAQ. Both the Buyer and Seller must see to this See our ToC&U.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Should the Buyer be satisfied with the items sent by the Seller, it is expected that the Buyer clicks on the “Satisfied. Pay the Seller” button.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once the Delivery Number has been verified and the Buyer has clicked the “Satisfied. Pay the Seller” button, Brigho will pay the money accrued from the transaction straight into the appropriate bank account(s).

                        <li>
                            Should the Buyer be dissatisfied with the items sent by the Seller, it is expected that the Buyer declines the transaction by clicking on the “Not Satisfied. Please Refund” button

                        <li>
                            The app will then display a breakdown of the amount to be refunded. The Buyer then confirms the refund and Brigho will refund the appropriate amount due the Buyer.

                    Brigho serves as an intermediary between two or more people who have agreed between and/or among
                    themselves to carry out a financial transaction for the exchange or a item. We receive money from
                    the potential Buyer, safe-keep the money in our custody for both the Buyer and the Seller. Only when both
                    the Seller and the Buyer complete the transaction do we send money for the item to the Seller.
                    A completed transaction is one in which the Buyer has collected the item sent by the Seller.
                    <span class="color-blue-light">
                        For this service we take a small commission of 2.5% on every transaction.

                </p>
                <p style="">
                    When the transaction cannot be completed between the Seller and the Buyer for whatever reason, money sent by the Buyer to Brigho for the purchase of the item is sent back to the Buyers account less the cost of delivery (which goes to the Seller) and the commission of 2.5% which goes to Brigho.
                </p>
                <p style="">
                    Brigho thus operates a functional warehousing account through which a Seller and a Buyer not too familiar with one another can successfully transact a business. We provide trust and assurance between two or more unknown parties who are interested in carrying out a transaction thus enabling and encouraging Nigerians to sell their items.

                    However, Brigho is not liable for any item being sent or purchased between the Buyer and the Seller.

                    happen when the Buyer is satisfied with the item(s) and wants to pay for it.
                </p>
                <p style="">
                    However, we expect that there will be situations where the Buyer upon seeing the item(s) would not want
                    to pay for the item(s) for several reasons such as damaged item(s), sub standard item(s), wrong item(s)
                    etc. In such situations, we understand that the Buyer will request a refund for his money.
                </p>
                <p style="">
                    Therefore, in cases where the Buyer wants to return the item(s), it is expected that there will be an
                    additional cost for shipping the item back to the Seller. This additional cost shall be split into 2
                    equals of 50% each between the Buyer and the Seller. Hence, in situations of refund requested by the Buyer,
                    s/he shall lose:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Full amount of the initial cost of delivery
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            An additional 50% of the initial cost of delivery
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            2.5% commission to Brigho
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p style="">
                    The full amount of the initial cost of delivery shall be paid to the Seller to recuperate his/her
                    initial payment to his logistic company/person incurred while sending the item(s) to the Buyer.
                </p>


                <p style=""> <p>
                    The additional 50% of the initial cost of delivery shall be paid to the Seller to offset 50% of the
                    cost he/her will incur to have his item(s) returned to him/her.
                </p>
                <p style="">
                    The 2.5% Brigho commission shall be service charge on this transaction accruing to Brigho.
                </p>
                <p style="">
                    The outstanding balance after these deductions shall be paid to the Buyer as his/her refund.
                </p>
                <p style="">
                    This shall be calculated as follows:

                        Brigho is a financial intermediary app that is owned by Brigho and HadRelTah Limited (B&H).
                        B&H is a registered company under Nigeria Law with the Corporate Affairs Commission with registration
                        number RC1760904. Among other things, we are licensed to carry out the functions of a financial
                        intermediary between a Seller and a Buyer who have agreed between/among themselves to carry out a
                        business transaction. Being licensed enables us to be sued by our clients in cases of breach of
                        contracts between us and our clients. We therefore do not take lightly transactions we enter into
                        via our Brigho app.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We function as a middleman between a Buyer(s) and Seller(s). Brigho plays the role of an intermediary in a
                        distribution or transaction chain and we facilitate interaction between the involved parties.
                        We specialize in performing crucial activities involved in the purchase and sale of goods in their
                        flow from producers to the ultimate buyers. In pursuance of our Memorandum of Association (MoA),
                        we own and operate the app Brigho which facilitates the achievements with our MoA.

                    <li>
                        We are not a haulage company and under no circumstances do not handle items on behalf of any Buyer or Seller.
                    </li>

                <ul class="listview simple-listview inset">
                    <li>
                        As a Buyer, it might be expected to once in a while receive items that you are not
                        comfortable with because they do not meet the standard you were expecting.
                        To this Brigho has no control over the quality of items that Sellers send.
                        It is expected that upon receiving the items, you inspect them and if they do
                        not meet your standard, you simply return the items by declining the transaction
                        via our Brigho app.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once you do this, Brigho will refund you the total cost of the agreed price of the
                        items less our Commission and the cost of Delivery or sending goods.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For the Seller, as Brigho is not a logistic company, it is expected that your
                        Delivery agent ensures that the Buyer returns the items in
                        the best acceptable way without damage to your items. Kindly note that Brigho
                        will not take liability for any damaged returned items.

                    <li>
                        Brigho will always ensure that the Bank account details correspond with what you
                        and the seller agree. However, in cases where there is an error(s) in these details,
                        Brigho get in contact with Buyer or Seller to cancel the transaction and initiate a
                        new transaction with the correct and accurate details.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Seller would then use the in-app Transaction Amendment and send an email to
                        Brigho containing the correct Bank details. Please note the name of the Bank Account
                        must be the same as in the initial transaction.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Only after this would Brigho send monies to any account

                <div class="listview-title mt-2"><h2> What happens if the Buyer collects the good without entering the Delivery Code?</h2></div>

                        Unfortunately, Brigho has no control over the process of Delivery
                        and will only release money to the Seller when the Buyer has activated the Delivery Code.
                        It is the sole responsibility of the Buyer and Seller to ensure the delivery code is
                        entered into the Brigho app. More specifically, it is expected that the Seller must
                        ensure he receives a confirmation from Brigho as regards the use of the delivery code
                        before releasing the items to the Buyer. We expect the Seller to ensure this is
                        done before the logistic personnel releases the item to the Buyer
                    </li>

                        We would not encourage anyone to pay for a good/item he or she is not satisfied with.
                        Hence, if dissatisfied with a items being purchased, kindly decline the transaction
                        via the Brigho app, and leave the good/item with the Seller’s agent. Brigho will then
                        ensure you get your refunded into your indicated Bank account less the cost of the
                        initial Delivery, an additional 50% of the cost of
                        Delivery which both go to the Seller and our commission on
                        that transaction. Kindly note that on such occasion as a dissatisfied good/item which
                        you do not want, ensure you do not use the accept the transaction via the app. If you
                        do this, based on our ToC&U, we will be forced to make full payment to the Seller for
                        the transaction.

                    <li>
                        The Seller who also pays 50% of the cost of Delivery, adds
                        the 50% of the Delivery paid by the Seller and then makes
                        payment to the logistic company to return to items back to him.

                    <li>
                        The initial payment for Delivery is a refund to the Seller
                        for him sending the goods to you. Remember, The Seller uses his own funds to cater for
                        this initial expense. However, in case you want to return the item, the cost of returning
                        the good/item is being shared 50-50 between the buyer and the seller. Thus, we try to
                        discourage the Seller from sending sub standard goods to the Seller and ensuring the Seller
                        receives the best possible good thus the issue of a refund is very unlikely.

                        and agreed to by the Seller.

                        delivery services. Thus, it is expected that the Seller and Buyer

                        To this end, you must be certain you want the item/good before verifying the delivery number
